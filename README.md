# Campaign

## PRELUDE

The players are mercenaries hired by the Sterk Trading Company, at the service of the Burgundian Diplomatic Mission.

Characters are introduced to their units and their superiors. The player characters
are _for obvious reasons_ grouped together.


## Chapter 1 : from the Lowlands to Constantinople

The duke has commissioned a diplomatic mission / caravan company to the Byzantine city of Constantinople,
in order to establish the first trading outpost towards the far east.

### ACT 1 : the Imperial Court of Aachen

Trading with the infidels requires a special permission from the Holy Roman Emperor.
While the officers take care of the boring part, the players need to recover the
mission's plans from a company of thieves.

### Act 2 : the Bank of Frankfurt

In order to make money, you need to spend money. You also need money... lots of gold.
The Duke instructed the Company to get funds from his personal account in Frankfurt, however those funds
have vanished from the vault. A hole in the ground leads to a mysterious tunnel, where they encounter
a group of small, burly, and bearded people.

### Act 3 : the Forgotten Church of Bamberg

Bamberg is widely known for its hills crowned by churches. Seven hills, crowned by seven churches.
What many were not aware, was that a church was built beneath the city's town hall.
While the officers pay homage to the church, the players are sent to investigate
what lies bellow the town hall.

### Act 4 : Bavarian beer!

The company is shaken by what they encountered on the church. The captain instructed everybody to keep
a secret about it, or he would be forced to cut some tongues. In order to boost morale, the mission
diverts south, to Munchen, where they will be able to enjoy all the beer they can drink, paid by the Duke.
On their way there, however, the caravan is attacked by a group of wolves. Wolves as big as a bull.
They manage to scare away the horses, and the players need to find them while the rest of the company protects
the caravan.

### Act 5 : Salzburg Thermals

In order to cure the hangover, the captain directs the caravan towards Salzburg. Home to hot springs and thermals.
When it is their time to enjoy the hot waters, however, the characters are greeted by a BIG surprise in the waters.

### Act 6 : the Habsburgian Affair in Vienna

Albert III and Leopold III fought over who would control the Habsburgian lands in Austria, and further
lead the Habsburguian family as the next Holy Roman Emperor. The players are approached by both sides,
asking for their support on a 'special mission' towards the other's lands. They can choose to pick a side,
or remain loyal to the Emperor and expose their plans to the public.

### Act 7 : The Catacombs of Bratislava

The company is getting ready to leave Austria, when some of the caravaneers rush towards
the officers asking for their help. One of the crew left two night ago to visit a relative, and never returned.
The relative was buried in the Catacombs of Bratislava. In there, the characters encounter a ghostly creature,
asking to be reunited with its body. The only problem: it's dead body is still walking.


### Act 8 : Funding the Hungarian Crusade (part 1)

The company reaches Budapest, and all is good. Only not.
News that the Ottomans have assembled an army, and were marching through Serbia, into the lands
of the Kingdom of Hungary. The king has reacted accordingly, and is marching to receive the Ottomans
in Serbia. The regent has remained in power, and is demanding the caravan's wealth in order
to supply the new Crusade against the Ottomans.

### Act 9 : Funding the Hungarian Crusade (part 2)

Captured, the caravaneers are sent into prison and their wealth confiscated.
They need to find a way to free themselves, the rest of the crew, recover the caravan goods, and flee Hungary.

### Act 10 : It was a mistake to come to Wallachia

The caravan regroups and flees Hungary via Wallachia. The Voivode promised them safe passage, as long as they were
willing to pay for that protection. The officers agreed. Unbeknownst to them, they would have to pay tribute in blood.

### Act 11 : The Ottoman camps near Edirne

Having lost most of the crew, the officers direct the caravan towards Edirne, where they seek to speak with the
Ottoman emissaries following behind the army sent to attack Hungary. The officers want to negociate a safe passage,
but are greeted by savage men harassing the Turks.

### Act 12 : Istanbul, not Constantinople

The caravan reaches Constantinople. Or what is left of it.
The officers managed an audience with Emperor John V, only to be greeted by his grandson, John VII.
He claims his father is grandfather is dead, and he is the new Emperor.
But the truth is far more sinister than that, and the world will never more be the same.

### Conclusion

With the death of John VII, his grandfather is released from his magical prison.
However, by shattering the magical device his grandson brought from the East, Magic has started
to spread in between the population, and mythical creatures becoming a common sight across the land.
